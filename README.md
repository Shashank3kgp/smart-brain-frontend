#SMART BRAIN
Hi, everyone I am shashank Thupakula. This is the repo of my project smart brain where 
users can register, sign in, and sign out. Once the user registers and login, he can put 
any URL of any image and this application will generate the image that URL contains 
with detecting faces in that image.

Below is the link of demonstration of the project:
